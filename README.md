# Bookmarks React Client: Checkpoint 19 (Deployment)
_This project is a demonstration for Thinkful's React course_

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Deploy link: https://bookmarks-app.shiningjustice.now.sh

Notes: 
* There was some trouble with using the `CI` environment variable within the `package.json`. I can only assume it's because it wasn't being added when this app was originally made (I used Thinkful's version of the bookmarks, so it may not up to date with what the curriculum had originally asked). I made note to use this in the future but didn't want to spend too much time figuring it out for an older checkpoint. 
* It seems I didn't need to apply the alias as Zeit is doing something similar now with incorporating the user's links as their own internally set alias. I did make note of how to do this manually, though,
